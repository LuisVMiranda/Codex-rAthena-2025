bMonsterScholar [OK] - How to Install
=====================================

1) Apply the patch
   - Apply `bMonsterScholar.diff` to your source tree.

2) Rebuild map-server
   - Run your standard build steps for rAthena.

3) Use in item/script bonus
   - Syntax: `bonus bMonsterScholar,<n>;`
   - Recommended: `bonus bMonsterScholar,1;`

Behavior
--------
- Reads permanent character variable `MobKillCount_<RaceID>`.
- For every 1000 kills of that race, grants +0.1% Physical and Magical damage against that race.
- Max bonus is +5.0% per race.
- PvE-only restriction: does NOT apply to `RC_PLAYER_HUMAN` or `RC_PLAYER_DORAM`.

Variable management
-------------------
- This patch reads counters but does not force a single source of incrementing.
- You can increment variables from scripts, quests, or custom kill hooks, e.g.:
  `setd("MobKillCount_" + <RaceID>, getd("MobKillCount_" + <RaceID>) + 1);`

Notes
-----
- `bCampfireRate` is also documented as alias of `bCampfireHeal` in `doc/item_bonus.txt`.
