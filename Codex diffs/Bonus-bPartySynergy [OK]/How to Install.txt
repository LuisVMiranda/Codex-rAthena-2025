Party Synergy (bPartySynergy) - How to Install
=============================================

This package is the unified/updated version of:
- bonus_party_synergy
- Bonus-bPartySynergy [OK]

1) Apply code changes
   - Apply `bonus_party_synergy.diff` from this folder to your source tree.

2) Rebuild map-server
   - Run your normal build steps for rAthena.

3) Use the new bonus in scripts/items
   - Bonus name: bPartySynergy
   - Syntax: bonus bPartySynergy,<value>;
   - Recommended value: 1

Behavior
--------
- Counts unique class lines from ONLINE party members on the SAME map.
- Every 4 unique classes grants +1 to all basic stats (STR/AGI/VIT/INT/DEX/LUK).
- Maximum synergy stacks: 4 (up to +4 all stats when value is 1).
- Final bonus applied is: (synergy_stacks * script_value).
- Recalculates on party join/leave/map-state updates.

Polish/Safety notes
-------------------
- Includes guarded status recalculation to avoid unsafe login-bootstrap timing.
- Exposes bPartySynergy in script constants and readparam handling.
- Kept stat-bonus application under the non-arrow bonus path to match standard bonus behavior.

Example
-------
bonus bPartySynergy,1;
