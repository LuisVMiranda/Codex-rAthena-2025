Party Synergy (bPartySynergy) - How to Install
=============================================

1) Apply code changes
   - Apply `bonus_party_synergy.diff` from this folder to your source tree.

2) Rebuild map-server
   - Run your normal build steps for rAthena.

3) Use the new bonus in scripts/items
   - Bonus name: bPartySynergy
   - Syntax: bonus bPartySynergy,<value>;
   - Recommended value: 1

Behavior
--------
- Counts unique base class lines from party members on the same map.
- Every 4 unique classes grants +1 to all basic stats (STR/AGI/VIT/INT/DEX/LUK).
- Maximum synergy stacks: 4 (up to +4 all stats when value is 1).
- Recalculates when party membership/map state changes.

Example
-------
